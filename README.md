# Leukocyte microscopy automation project
Package for automating leukocyte microscopy implemented in Python with used PyTorch deep learning framework.

This application was created as part of a decision support system for a microscopy automation project. 
At the heart of the working are two convolutional neural networks. First for segmentation, second for classification.
The pipeline of detection and classification of leukocytes is presented in the figure below.
